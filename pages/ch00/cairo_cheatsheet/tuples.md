# Tuples

Tuples is a data type to group a fixed number of items of potentially different types into a single compound structure. Unlike arrays, tuples have a set length and can contain elements of varying types. Once a tuple is created, its size cannot change.

For example:

<<<<<<<< HEAD:src/getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/tuples.md
```cairo
{{#include ../../../listings/getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/tuple_example.cairo:sheet}}
========
```rust
// [!include ~/listings/getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/tuple_example.cairo:sheet]

```
