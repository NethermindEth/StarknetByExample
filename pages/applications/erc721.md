# ERC721 Token

Contracts that follow the [ERC721 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) are called ERC721 tokens. They are used to represent non-fungible assets.

:::note
For a deeper understanding of the ERC721 interface specifications and its functionality, we highly recommend reading the EIP in detail.

To create an ERC721 contract, it must implement the following interface:

```cairo
// [!include ~/listings/applications/erc721/src/interfaces.cairo:interface]
```

Because function names in Starknet should be written in _snake_case_, the Starknet ERC721 interface is slightly different from the Solidity ERC721 interface which uses _camelCase_.

Here's an implementation of the ERC721 interface in Cairo:

```cairo
// [!include ~/listings/applications/erc721/src/erc721.cairo]
```

There are other implementations, such as the [Open Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/erc721) one.
