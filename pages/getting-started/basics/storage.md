# Storage

## Basic Contract Structure

Every Starknet contract must be defined as a module with the `#[starknet::contract]` attribute. Here's the simplest possible Cairo contract:

```cairo
// [!include ~/listings/getting-started/storage/src/minimal_contract.cairo:contract]
```

## Contract Storage Basics

Storage in Cairo contracts is implemented as a key-value store using a struct marked with the `#[storage]` attribute. Every contract must have exactly one storage definition, which serves as the contract's persistent state on the blockchain and is kept between contract executions.

### Storage Variables

You can define [Storage Variables](/getting-started/basics/variables#storage-variables) to store and retrieve data in your contract:

```cairo
// [!include ~/listings/getting-started/storage/src/contract.cairo:contract]
```

:::note
ðŸ’¡ **Optimization Tip**: Both contracts above generate identical Sierra code. The compiler only generates code for storage variables that are actually used in contract functions. Declaring unused storage variables has no impact on contract size or gas costs.

For more complex data structures, see [Storing Custom Types](/getting-started/basics/storing-custom-types).

### Storage Space (advanced)

The contract's storage space consists of $2^{251}$ *storage slots*, where each slot:

- Can store a single `felt252` value
- Is initialized to 0
- Has a unique address that can be accessed using `selector!("variable_name")` for primitive types

In our previous contract example:

- Variable `a` (u128):
  - Address: `selector!("a")`
  - Uses first 128 bits of the slot
  - Leaves 124 bits unused
- Variable `b` (u8):
  - Address: `selector!("b")`
  - Uses first 8 bits of the slot
  - Leaves 244 bits unused
- Variable `c` (u256)
  - An u256 cannot fit in a single slot
  - Base address: `selector!("c")`
  - Uses two consecutive slots:
    - First slot: lower 128 bits at `selector!("c")`
    - Second slot: upper 128 bits at `selector!("c") + 1`
  - Leaves 248 bits unused

:::note
ðŸ’¡ **Storage Optimization**: Notice how many bits are left unused in each slot? This can make storage operations expensive. To optimize storage usage, you can pack multiple variables together. Learn more in [Storage Optimisation](/advanced-concepts/optimisations/store_using_packing).
