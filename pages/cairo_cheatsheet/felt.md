# Felt

`felt252` is a fundamental data type in Cairo from which all other data types are derived.
`felt252` can also be used to store 'short string representations' with a maximum length of 31 characters.

For example:

```cairo
// [!include ~/listings/cairo_cheatsheet/src/felt_example.cairo:sheet]
```
