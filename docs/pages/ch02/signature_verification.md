# ECDSA Verification

This is the Cairo adaptation of the [Solidity by example Verifying Signature](https://solidity-by-example.org/signature/)
Messages can be signed off chain and then verified on chain using a smart contract.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/advanced-concepts/ecdsa_verification/src/ecdsa_verification.cairo]
```
