# Match

The "match" expression in Cairo allows us to control the flow of our code by comparing a felt data type or an enum against various patterns and then running specific code based on the pattern that matches.
For example:

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/match_example.cairo]
```
