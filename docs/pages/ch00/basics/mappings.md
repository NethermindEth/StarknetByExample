# Mappings

Maps are a key-value data structure used to store data within a smart contract. In Cairo they are implemented using the `LegacyMap` type. It's important to note that the `LegacyMap` type can only be used inside the `Storage` struct of a contract and that it can't be used elsewhere.

Here we demonstrate how to use the `LegacyMap` type within a Cairo contract, to map between a key of type `ContractAddress` and value of type `felt252`. The key-value types are specified within angular brackets <>. We write to the map by calling the `write()` method, passing in both the key and value. Similarly, we can read the value associated with a given key by calling the `read()` method and passing in the relevant key.</>

Some additional notes:

- More complex key-value mappings are possible, for example we could use `LegacyMap::<(ContractAddress, ContractAddress), felt252>` to create an allowance on an ERC20 token contract.

- In mappings, the address of the value at key `k_1,...,k_n` is `h(...h(h(sn_keccak(variable_name),k_1),k_2),...,k_n)` where `ℎ` is the Pedersen hash and the final value is taken `mod2251−256`. You can learn more about the contract storage layout in the [Starknet Documentation](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Smart_Contracts/contract-storage/#storage_variables)
