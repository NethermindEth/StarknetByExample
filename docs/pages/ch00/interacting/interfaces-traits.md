# Contract interfaces and Traits generation

Contract interfaces define the structure and behavior of a contract, serving as the contract's public ABI. They list all the function signatures that a contract exposes. For a detailed explanation of interfaces, you can refer to the [Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch99-01-02-a-simple-contract.html).

In cairo, to specify the interface you need to define a trait annotated with `#[starknet::interface]` and then implement that trait in the contract.

When a function needs to access the contract state, it must have a `self` parameter of type `ContractState`. This implies that the corresponding function signature in the interface trait must also take a `TContractState` type as a parameter. It's important to note that every function in the contract interface must have this `self` parameter of type `TContractState`.

You can use the `#[generate_trait]` attribute to implicitly generate the trait for a specific implementation block. This attribute automatically generates a trait with the same functions as the ones in the implemented block, replacing the `self` parameter with a generic `TContractState` parameter. However, you will need to annotate the block with the `#[abi(per_item)]` attribute, and each function with the appropriate attribute depending on whether it's an external function, a constructor or a l1 handler.

In summary, there's two ways to handle interfaces:

- Explicitly, by defining a trait annoted with `#[starknet::interface]`
- Implicitly, by using `#[generate_trait]` combined with the `#[abi(per_item)]` attributes, and annotating each function inside the implementation block with the appropriate attribute.

## Explicit interface

:::code-group

```rust [contract]
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/getting-started/interfaces_traits/src/explicit.cairo:contract]
```

```rust [tests]
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/getting-started/interfaces_traits/src/explicit.cairo:tests]
```

## Implicit interface

:::code-group

```rust [contract]
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/getting-started/interfaces_traits/src/implicit.cairo:contract]
```

```rust [tests]
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/getting-started/interfaces_traits/src/implicit.cairo:tests]
```

> Note: You can import an implicitly generated contract interface with `use contract::{GeneratedContractInterface}`. However, the `Dispatcher` will not be generated automatically.

## Internal functions

You can also use `#[generate_trait]` for your internal functions.
Since this trait is generated in the context of the contract, you can define pure functions as well (functions without the `self` parameter).

```rust [contract]
// [!include ~/snippets/listings/getting-started/interfaces_traits/src/implicit_internal.cairo:contract]
