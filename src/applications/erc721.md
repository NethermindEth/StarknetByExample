# ERC721 Token

Contracts that follow the [ERC721 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) are called ERC721 tokens. They are used to represent non-fungible assets.

To create an ERC721 contract, it must implement the following interface:

```rust
{{#include ../../listings/applications/721/src/interfaces.cairo:interface}}
```

Becase function names in Starknet should be written in _snake_case_, the Starknet ERC721 interface is slightly different from the Solidity ERC721 interface which uses _camelCase_.

Here's an implementation of the ERC721 interface in Cairo:

```rust
{{#include ../../listings/applications/721/src/erc721.cairo}}
```

There are other implementations, such as the [Open Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.7.0/erc721) one.
