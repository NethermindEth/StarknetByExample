# Staking contract

The following staking contract is designed to allow users to stake tokens in exchange for reward tokens over a specified duration. Here's a quick summary of how it operates and what functionalities it supports:

### Key Features:

1. Token staking and unstaking:

   - Users can stake an ERC20 token, specified at deployment.
   - Users can withdraw their staked tokens at any time.

2. Reward calculation and distribution:

   - The rewards are distributed as an ERC20, also specified at deployment (can be different from the staking token).
   - Rewards are calculated based on the duration of staking and the amount the user staked relative to the total staked amount by all users.
   - A userâ€™s reward accumulates over time up until the reward period's end and can be claimed anytime by the user.

3. Dynamic reward rates:

   - The reward rate is determined by the total amount of reward tokens over a set period (duration).
   - The reward rate can be adjusted during the rewards period if new rewards are added before the current reward period finishes.
   - Even after a reward period finishes, a new reward duration and new rewards can be set up if desired.

4. Ownership and administration:
   - Only the owner of the contract can set the rewards amount and duration.

> The reward mechanism ensures that rewards are distributed fairly based on the amount and duration of tokens staked by each user.

The following implementation is the Cairo adaptation of the [Solidity by Example - Staking Rewards contract](https://solidity-by-example.org/defi/staking-rewards/). It includes a small adaptation to keep track of the amount of total distributed reward tokens and emit an event when the remaining reward token amount reaches 0.
