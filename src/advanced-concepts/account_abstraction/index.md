# Account Abstraction

An account is an unique entity that can send transactions, users usually use wallets to manage their accounts.

Historically, in Ethereum, all accounts were Externally Owned Accounts (_EOA_) and were controlled by private keys. This is a simple and secure way to manage accounts, but it has limitations as the account logic is hardcoded in the protocol.

Account Abstraction (_AA_) is the concept behind abstracting parts of the account logic to allow for a more flexible account system.
This replaces EOA with Account Contracts, which are smart contracts that implement the account logic. This opens up a lot of possibilities that can significantly improve the user experience when dealing with accounts.

On Starknet, Account Abstraction is natively supported, and all accounts are Account Contracts.
