# Storing Custom Types

While native types can be stored in a contract's storage without any additional work, custom types require a bit more work. This is because at compile time, the compiler does not know how to store custom types in storage. To solve this, we need to implement the `Store` trait for our custom type. Hopefully, we can just derive this trait for our custom type - unless it contains arrays or dictionaries.

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch00-introduction/storing_custom_types/src/lib.cairo}}
```
