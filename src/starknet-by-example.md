# Starknet by Example

Starknet By Example is a collection of examples of how to use the Cairo programming language to create smart contracts on Starknet.

Starknet is a permissionless Validity-Rollup that supports general computation. It is currently used as an Ethereum layer-2. Starknet use the STARK cryptographic proof system to ensure high safety and scalability.

Starknet smart contracts are written in the Cairo language. Cairo is a Turing-complete programming language designed to write provable programs, abstracting the zk-STARK proof system away from the programmer.

## For whom is this for?

Starknet By Example is for anyone who wants to quickly learn how to write smart contracts on Starknet using Cairo with some technical background in programming and blockchain.

The first chapters will give you a basic understanding of the Cairo programming language and how to write, deploy and use smart contracts on Starknet.
The later chapters will cover more advanced topics and show you how to write more complex smart contracts.
