# Plugins

Compiler plugins in Cairo are a way to generate additional code for specific items during the compilation process.

There are already a set of core plugins that you may have already used, such as `#[derive]`, `#[cfg]`, `#[generate_trait]`, etc.

It is possible to create your own plugins in Cairo. You can learn more about how to do that in the [hello-cairo-plugin](https://github.com/piwonskp/hello-cairo-plugin) repository.
