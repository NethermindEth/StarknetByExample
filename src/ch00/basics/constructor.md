# Constructor

Constructors are a special type of function that runs only once when deploying a contract, and can be used to initialize the state of the contract. Your contract must not have more than one constructor, and that constructor function must be annotated with the `#[constructor]` attribute. Also, a good practice consists in naming that function `constructor`.

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to initialize the state of a contract on deployment by defining logic inside a constructor.

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../../../listings/getting-started/constructor/src/constructor.cairo:contract}}
```
