# Felt252

Felt252 is a fundamental data type in Cairo from which all other data types are derived.
Felt252 can also be used to store [short string representations](../basics/bytearrays-strings.md#short-strings) with a maximum length of 31 characters.

For example:

```rust
{{#include ../../../listings/getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/felt_example.cairo:sheet}}
```
