# Struct

A struct is a data type similar to tuple. Like tuples they can be used to hold data of different types.

## Minimal example

Here's a minimal example of a code base that struct to store the address and age of the last person to iteract with the store_struct function in the contract:


```rust
{{#include ../../../listings/ch00-getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/struct_example.cairo}}
```
