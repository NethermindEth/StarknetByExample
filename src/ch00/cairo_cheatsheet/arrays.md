# Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements of the same type, they have a very limited modification option in the sense that we can only append (push) into them from the bottom and then pop out of the array from the top. For example:



```rust
{{#include ../../../listings/ch00-getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/array_example.cairo}}
```
