# `if let`

A `if let` statement is a combination of an `if` statement and a `let` statement. It allows you to execute the block only if the pattern matches. It's a cleaner way to handle a `match` statement with only one pattern that you want to handle.

```rust
{{#include ../../../listings/getting-started/cairo_cheatsheet/src/if_let_example.cairo:sheet}}
```
